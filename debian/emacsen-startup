;; The youtube-dl-el package follows the Debian/GNU Linux 'emacsen' policy and
;; byte-compiles its elisp files for each 'emacs flavor' (emacs19,
;; xemacs19, emacs20, xemacs20...).  The compiled code is then
;; installed in a subdirectory of the respective site-lisp directory.
;; Nevertheless, we do not have to take care of load-path list
;; because youtube-dl-el does it itself.

;; If package-dir does not exist, the sepia package must have
;; removed but not purged, and we should skip the setup.
